# Demo

Hi,

Welcome to the Demo Application that I've created for my interview with bidmii.
To run this application, you need Spring Tool Suite. And then follow these steps:

1. Click on pom.xml and then "Run as" and then "Maven clean".
2. Again Click on pom.xml and then "Run as" and then "Maven install".
3. The above step will create a war file in target folder.
4. Now, click on the project folder and then click "Run as" and then "SpringBoot Application".
